# House Rules / Reference

## Rounding

All rolls/values rounded up

## Floating Criticals 

On a roll of 2 on Hit Location Table, roll again and apply critical hit on rolled location.

## Forced Withdrawal*

Under **Forced Withdrawal** rules, **crippled** 'Mechs must retreat towards 
it's home map edge.

- Four damage to Mechwarrior/pilot
- Destroyed all sensor critical slots
- A gyro and an engine critical hit (or two engine critical hits)
- Loss of all weapons (or 'Mech cannot cause more than 5 damage)

## Auto-Ejection

A Mechwarrior will automatically eject when an ammo explosion occurs on its 
torso and takes 2 pts of damage due to feedback. 


## Movement Marker/Dice

Use two distinct color d6's for movement mod and hexes moved. First d6 is the 
movement mode (walked [+1], ran [+2], or jumped[+3]) and second d6 for number of hexes moved.


## Group Firing and Location Hits*

Use a distinct 1d6 as a *pilot* die and additional 1d6 (of different size/color) 
**for each weapon**. Compare the *pilot* die to each weapon die for hits/misses. Do 
the same for location hits.


## Cluster Rolls/Hits*

Instead of using the Cluster hit table, use the following steps: 

- Roll a die for each cluster (LRMs: 5pt cluster per d6, SRMs: 1 missile per d6)
- A roll of 3+ results as a cluster hit.
- If LRM cluster (or SRM launcher not missile) misses, deal 2pts of damage minimum.
